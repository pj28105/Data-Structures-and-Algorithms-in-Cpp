if you are given a square grid then total squares in that grid would be
sum(n*n) where n goes from 1 to n

for eg- in 8 x 8 total squares are 
    8 * 8 + 7 * 7 + 6 * 6 ...... + 1 * 1

Logic -> In 8 x 8 gird there are 9 vertical and horizontal lines now count one by one the total squares of variable sizes
total 1 x 1 squares in 8 x 8 grid are 64 (8 vertical and 8 horizontal lines are possible)
total 2 x 2 squares in 8 x 8 grid are 49  (7 vertical and 7 horizontal lines are possible)


To count total rectanges in 8 x 8 grid 
formula is 9C2 * 9C2 

Logic -> You can select any two horizontal and vertical lines to form rectangle 
Note -> A square is also a rectangles
